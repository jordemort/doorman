# doorman

This is a tool to assist in running old BBS [door games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_(bulletin_board_system)) for DOS on a Linux system.
It does this with the assistance of a [container](https://github.com/jordemort/doorman-container) which contains [dosemu2](https://github.com/dosemu2/dosemu2) and [Qodem](https://qodem.sourceforge.io/).
The program in this repository is essentially a fancy launcher for the container.
